We collect and distribute data about what kinds of activities people feel good about after the fact, versus which activities people tend to regret.\r\n\r\nWe also make available software and demo code for making recommendation systems that take this data into account.\r\n\r\nIn the future we hope to administer a \"Time Well Spent\" label that will appear across the web and apps, to help users everywhere choose options they are unlikely to regret.\r\n\r\nFounded by Joe Edelman (@jxe) in 2013.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
